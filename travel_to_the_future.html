            <div id="information-text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text
                 of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum 
                 has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
                  the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                   and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
                    five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
                    essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the 
                    release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and 
                    more recently with desktop publishing
                 software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div>

                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
                 by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
                  Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
                 as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</div>
